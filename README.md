# Using-Python-to-Evaluate-Risk-in-Commercial-Avaition-Operations
This analysis utilizes Python to analyze distributions of flight data to identify risk in flight operations.  The data would likely come from what is called Flight Operatios Quality Assurance (FOQA) data.  Since the data is comprehensive and stored with an operator, through the use of statistical models, an organization can track trends in data to identify when and where to address risk that would normally go undetected until an undesireable outcome occured.  The primary method is to establish benchmark data sets.  Then through statistical analysis of the data with Python you can determine the right course of action.  Since all commercial aircraft are operated by humans, the distribution of outcomes should be normally distributed.  The skew, and variance of that data will give you clues as to how the aircraft are being operated and will give an operator a tool to measure risk.
